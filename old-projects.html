        <h3>Review Sentiment Classifier</h3>
        <h5>Feb 2024 - May 2024 - Academic Project</h5>
        <p>GitHub Repo: <a href="https://github.com/Callum-OP/Review-Sentiment-Classifier">https://github.com/Callum-OP/Review-Sentiment-Classifier</a></p>
        <p>University Assignment: Learning models capable of conducting sentiment classification. Decided to use Amazon product 
            reviews as a data source. Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) classifier and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) deep neural network 
            were chosen as the models to compare, both trained to sort reviews into positive, negative and neutral categories. 
            Compared both models, using f1 scores I could see MLP was more accurate at predicting sentiment compared to MNB classifier but 
            took far longer to train. While the project went well I could have also used TensorFlow models or another neural network to make it more interesting.</p>
        <p>The MLP neural network that I used had 83% accuracy, the f1 scores for each sentiment are as follows; 0.93 for positive reviews, 0.82 for negative reviews and 
            0.36 for neutral reviews. The f1 scores seem to match the amount of data stored as positive had the most review data and neutral had the least, if I had an even amount 
            of training data for each sentiment the accuracy would likely be more consistent and accurate. 
        </p>

            Features:
            <ul>
                <li>View predicted sentiment of reviews.</li>
                <li>View tables showcasing accuracy of each model.</li>

        <h3>Voice Controlled Light</h3>
        <h5>Feb 2024 - May 2024 - Academic Project</h5>
        <p>GitHub Repo: <a href="https://github.com/Callum-OP/Voice-Controlled-Light">https://github.com/Callum-OP/Voice-Controlled-Light</a></p>
        <p>University Assignment: A C++ machine learning model for controlling lights through voice commands using a Arduino Nano 
            33 BLE Sense and Edge Impulse to train and compile the model. Trained model on audio collected manually through the Arduino mic. 
            Downloaded model on to Arduino, modified Arduino code so that it would light up different LEDs depending on which words were detected, 
            tested model and it worked well.</p>
        <p>The system had originally been very accurate but the more phrases I added that were similar such as; Bedroom Light vs Livingroom Light, 
            then the more likely the model will mix the words up. I may have made this more complicated by using multiple command phrases and could 
            be better off with more unique command words. Either way the model had 70% accuracy when tested live despite a low number of audio samples.</p>

            Features:
            <ul>
                <li>Activate different lights on Arduino based on commands.</li>
                <li>Turn off specific lights on Arduino using command phrases.</li>
                <li>View predicted command and predicted accuracy on Arduino IDE.</li>
            </ul>
