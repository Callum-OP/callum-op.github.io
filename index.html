        <br>
        <p>I am <b>Callum O'Prey</b>, a computer science graduate that I studied at Ulster University between 2020-2024. 
            On the third year at university I attended a 12 month placement at the Northern 
            Ireland Civil Service doing 2nd Line Support.</p>
        <p>I had been interested in computing since high school but it wasn't until I attended the South 
            Eastern Regional College and Ulster University that I gained a love of programming and creating programs or games.</p>
        <p>Other than programming I have a love of drawing and a love of games and I also like to play piano.</p>
        <br>
