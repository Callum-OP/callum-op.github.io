            <h3>Who I am</h3>
            <p>Hello! I'm <b>Callum O'Prey</b>, a Computer Science graduate from Ulster University in Belfast, Northern Ireland. 
                I studied from 2020 to 2024, achieving First-Class Honours and earning recognition with the Dean’s List Award 
                and Ulster Edge Excel Award.</p>

            <p>During my third year, I completed a year-long placement as a 2nd Line Support Analyst with the 
                Northern Ireland Civil Service. I tackled hundreds of incidents and collaborated with colleagues 
                via Microsoft Teams which helped me sharpen my problem-solving and technical 
                communication skills.</p>

            <h3>My interests</h3>
            <p>My passion for computing began in high school, but it truly took shape during my time at South Eastern 
                Regional College and later at Ulster. It was there that I discovered a deep love for programming, 
                building applications from the ground up, and bringing ideas to life whether through game mechanics or 
                full-stack development. Now I know programming languages such as Python, Java, C#, C++, PHP and JavaScript/Typescript as well as HTML/CSS. 
                I don't really have a preferred programming language, to me they all feel the same, similarily 
                I don't have a preference between backend or frontend which is why I enjoy making full stack applications and have 
                used such a wide variety of programming languages.</p>

            <p>Beyond code, I’m a creative at heart. I enjoy drawing, and I often explore both landscape and character design. 
                I'm also a self-taught pianist, learning to play music that I enjoy or find meaningful. 
                These artistic outlets keep my work dynamic and help me approach technical challenges with a creative edge.</p>
            <p>I take pride in continuously developing my skills and developing a variety of applications.</p>
