            <h3>Who I am</h3>
            <p>Hello! I'm <b>Callum O'Prey</b>, a Computer Science graduate from Ulster University in Belfast, Northern Ireland. 
                I studied from 2020 to 2024, achieving First-Class Honours and earning recognition with the Dean’s List Award 
                and Ulster Edge Excel Award.</p>

            <p>During my third year at university, I completed a year-long placement as a 2nd Line Support Analyst with the 
                Northern Ireland Civil Service. I tackled computer incidents and communicated with colleagues 
                via Microsoft Teams. My time there helped sharpen my problem-solving skills.</p>

            <h3>My interests</h3>
            <p>I have a passion for computing and a deep love for creating, naturally I grew to enjoy programming 
                as it allowed me to make whatever I desired. This includes but is not limited to games, websites, 
                full stack apps and learning models</p>

            <p>Beyond coding, I enjoy drawing, more recently digital drawing of landscapes, objects or characters. 
                I also enjoy playing a wide variety of games, if I'm not coding, drawing or playing games then I will
                probably be playing piano</p>
            
            <h3>Find out more</h3>
