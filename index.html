        <h3>Who I am</h3>
        <p>Hello! I'm <b>Callum O'Prey</b>, a Computer Science graduate from Ulster University in Belfast, Northern Ireland. 
            I studied from 2020 to 2024, achieving First-Class Honours and earning recognition with the Deanâ€™s List Award 
            and Ulster Edge Excel Award.</p>

        <p>During my third year at university, I completed a year-long placement as a 2nd Line Support Analyst with the 
            Northern Ireland Civil Service. I tackled computer incidents and communicated with colleagues 
            via Microsoft Teams. My time there helped sharpen my problem-solving skills.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>My interests</h3>
        <p>I have a passion for computing and a deep love for creating, naturally I grew to enjoy programming 
            as it allowed me to make whatever I desired. This includes but is not limited to games, websites, 
            full stack apps and learning models</p>

        <p>Beyond coding, I enjoy drawing, more recently digital drawing of landscapes, objects or characters. 
            I also enjoy playing a wide variety of games, if I'm not coding, drawing or playing games then I will
            probably be playing piano</p>
        <br>
