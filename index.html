        <h3>Who I am</h3>
        <p>Hello! I'm <b>Callum O'Prey</b>, a Computer Science graduate from Ulster University in Belfast, Northern Ireland. 
            I studied from 2020 to 2024, achieving First-Class Honours and earning recognition with the Deanâ€™s List Award 
            and Ulster Edge Excel Award.</p>

        <p>During my third year at university, I completed a year-long placement as a 2nd Line Support Analyst with the 
            Northern Ireland Civil Service. I tackled computer incidents and communicated with colleagues 
            via Microsoft Teams. My time there helped sharpen my problem-solving skills.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>My interests</h3>
        <p> I have a passion for computing, and I naturally grew to enjoy programming because 
            it allowed me to create whatever I imagined from games and websites to full-stack applications. 
            It isn't just a passion for computing but also a love for creating. Long before I understood how 
            to write code, I was building games and interactive stories using tools like 
            Scratch and GameMaker.</p>

        <p>I enjoy using several programming languages, C# is one of my first programming languages that I used 
            and still use now, mainly for creating scripts for games in Unity. I don't really have a single favourite programming language as different 
            languages are useful for different applications however the languages that I have used the most would likely be Python and TypeScript/JavaScript 
            as they have a wide range of uses.</p>

        <p>Beyond coding, I enjoy drawing, more recently digital drawing and animation of landscapes, objects or characters. 
            I also enjoy playing a wide variety of games, if I am not doing any of that then I am likely playing piano.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>My thoughts on AI</h3>
        <p>Only recently after graduating university have I experimented with using AI tools such as Microsoft Copilot, 
            often for debugging existing code and seeing how a feature could be implemented. When it comes to making 
            applications from scratch, AI is useful especially for 
            smaller, single file applications, allowing me to get a quick base for app and then modify it to 
            work how I want it to.</p> 
        <p>However when it comes to making larger applications or editing existing applications 
            AI often became unreliable and would forget the context of the app. It also depends on the programming language being used, I have noticed Copilot was quite good at Python and also able to generate reasonable JavaScript and HTML/CSS but when 
            it came to languages such as TypeScript and C++ the code it generated was often not reliable and would only slow me down.</p>
        <p>I have a similar opinion on AI for art, where it is good at generating quick concept images but usually not good enough to be the final product.</p>
