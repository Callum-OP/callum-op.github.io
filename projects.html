        <h3>Review Sentiment Classifier</h3>
        <h5>Feb 2024 - May 2024 - Academic Project</h5>
        <p>GitHub Repo: <a href="https://github.com/Callum-OP/Review-Sentiment-Classifier">https://github.com/Callum-OP/Review-Sentiment-Classifier</a></p>
        <p>University Assignment: Learning models capable of conducting sentiment classification. Decided to use Amazon product 
            reviews as a data source. Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) classifier and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) deep neural network 
            were chosen as the models to compare, both trained to sort reviews into positive, negative and neutral categories. 
            Compared both models, using f1 scores I could see MLP was more accurate at predicting sentiment compared to MNB classifier but 
            took far longer to train. Neutral sentiment was least likely to be detected from both models but this was likely 
            due to a lack of training data.</p>

            Features:
            <ul>
                <li>View predicted sentiment of reviews</li>

            33 BLE Sense and Edge Impulse to train and compile the model. Trained model on audio collected manually through the Arduino mic. 
            Downloaded model on to Arduino, modified Arduino code so that it would light up different LEDs depending on which words were detected, 
            tested model and it worked well.</p>

        <p>This is one of my longer and more impressive projects that I did in my own time while on placement with NICS, 
            the game had gone through many changes specifically to the map/terrain. Thee hardest part of this project was 
            finding assets that matched the art style.</p>
